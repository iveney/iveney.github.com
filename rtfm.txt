有一个古老而神圣的传统：如果你收到“RTFM”的回复，发信人认为你应该去“read the f**king manual”。他或她多半是对的，去读一下吧。
RTFM有个年轻一点的亲戚，如果你收到“STFW”的回复，发信人认为你应该“search the f**king web”。那人多半也是对的，去搜一下吧。(更温和一点的说法是 “谷歌是你的朋友！”)

你不应该觉得这样就被冒犯了，按黑客的标准，回复者没有不理你就是在向你表示某种尊敬，你反而应该感谢他热切地想帮助你。

There is an ancient and hallowed tradition: if you get a reply that reads
“RTFM”, the person who sent it thinks you should have Read The Fucking Manual.
He or she is almost certainly right. Go read it.

RTFM has a younger relative. If you get a reply that reads “STFW”, the person
who sent it thinks you should have Searched The Fucking Web. He or she is
almost certainly right. Go search it. (The milder version of this is when you
are told “Google is your friend!”)

You shouldn't be offended by this; by hacker standards, your respondent is
showing you a rough kind of respect simply by not ignoring you. You should
instead be thankful for this grandmotherly kindness.
