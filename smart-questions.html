how to get help.  That's fine, it's the use we intended — but if
you are a webmaster creating such a link for your project page, please
display prominently near the link notice that <span class="emphasis"><em>we are not a
help desk for your project!</em></span></p><p>We have learned the hard way that without such a notice, we will
repeatedly be pestered by idiots who think having published this
document makes it our job to solve all the world's technical
problems.</p><p>If you're reading this document because you need help, and you
walk away with the impression you can get it directly from the authors
of this document, <span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> are one of the idiots in
question.  Don't ask <span class="emphasis"><em>us</em></span> questions.  We'll just
ignore you.  We are here to show you how to get help from people who
actually know about the software or hardware you're dealing with, but
99.9% of the time that will not be us.  Unless you know for
<span class="emphasis"><em>certain</em></span> that one of the authors is an expert on
what you're dealing with, leave us alone and everybody will be
happier.</p></div><div class="sect1" xml:lang="en" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both;"><a id="intro"></a>Introduction</h2></div></div></div><p>In the world of <a href="http://www.catb.org/%7Eesr/faqs/hacker-howto.html" target="_top">hackers</a>, the kind of
answers you get to your technical questions depends as much on the way
you ask the questions as on the difficulty of developing the answer.
This guide will teach you how to ask questions in a way more likely
to get you a satisfactory answer.</p><p>Now that use of open source has become widespread, you can
often get as good answers from other, more experienced users as from
hackers. This is a Good Thing; users tend to be just a little bit more
tolerant of the kind of failures newbies often have. Still, treating
experienced users like hackers in the ways we recommend here will
generally be the most effective way to get useful answers out of them,
too.</p><p>The first thing to understand is that hackers actually like hard
problems and good, thought-provoking questions about them.  If we
didn't, we wouldn't be here.  If you give us an interesting question
to chew on we'll be grateful to you; good questions are a stimulus and
a gift.  Good questions help us develop our understanding, and often
reveal problems we might not have noticed or thought about otherwise.
Among hackers, “<span class="quote">Good question!</span>” is a strong and sincere
compliment.</p><p>Despite this, hackers have a reputation for meeting simple
questions with what looks like hostility or arrogance.  It sometimes
looks like we're reflexively rude to newbies and the ignorant.  But
this isn't really true.</p><p>What we are, unapologetically, is hostile to people who seem to
be unwilling to think or to do their own homework before asking
questions.  People like that are time sinks — they take without
giving back, and they waste time we could have spent on another question
more interesting and another person more worthy of an answer.  We call
people like this “<span class="quote">losers</span>” (and for historical reasons we
sometimes spell it “<span class="quote">lusers</span>”).</p><p>We realize that there are many people who just want to use the
software we write, and who have no interest in learning technical
details. For most people, a computer is merely a tool, a means to an
end; they have more important things to do and lives to live.  We
acknowledge that, and don't expect everyone to take an interest in the
technical matters that fascinate us.  Nevertheless, our style of
answering questions is tuned for people who <span class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span>
take such an interest and are willing to be active participants in
problem-solving.  That's not going to change.  Nor should it; if it
did, we would become less effective at the things we do best.</p><p>We're (largely) volunteers.  We take time out of busy lives to
answer questions, and at times we're overwhelmed with them.  So we
filter ruthlessly.  In particular, we throw away questions from people
who appear to be losers in order to spend our question-answering time
more efficiently, on winners.</p><p>If you find this attitude obnoxious, condescending, or arrogant,
check your assumptions.  We're not asking you to genuflect to us
— in fact, most of us would love nothing more than to deal with
you as an equal and welcome you into our culture, if you put in the
effort required to make that possible.  But it's simply not efficient
for us to try to help people who are not willing to help
themselves.  It's OK to be ignorant; it's not OK to play stupid.</p><p>So, while it isn't necessary to already be technically competent
to get attention from us, it <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> necessary to
demonstrate the kind of attitude that leads to competence —
alert, thoughtful, observant, willing to be an active partner in
developing a solution.  If you can't live with this sort of
discrimination, we suggest you pay somebody for a commercial support
contract instead of asking hackers to personally donate help to
you.</p><p>If you decide to come to us for help, you don't want to be one
of the losers.  You don't want to seem like one, either.  The best way
to get a rapid and responsive answer is to ask it like a person with
smarts, confidence, and clues who just happens to need help on one
particular problem.</p><p>(Improvements to this guide are welcome.  You can mail

Note however that this document is not intended to be a general guide
to <a href="http://www.dtcc.edu/cs/rfc1855.html" target="_top">netiquette</a>, and we
will generally reject suggestions that are not specifically related to
eliciting useful answers in a technical forum.)</p></div><div class="sect1" xml:lang="en" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both;"><a id="before"></a>Before You Ask</h2></div></div></div><p>Before asking a technical question by e-mail, or in a newsgroup, or on a
website chat board, do the following:</p><div class="procedure"><ol type="1"><li><p>Try to find an answer by searching the archives of the
forum you plan to post to.</p></li><li><p>Try to find an answer by searching the Web.</p></li><li><p>Try to find an answer by reading the manual.</p></li><li><p>Try to find an answer by reading a FAQ.</p></li><li><p>Try to find an answer by inspection or experimentation.</p></li><li><p>Try to find an answer by asking a skilled friend.</p></li><li><p>If you're a programmer, try to find an answer by reading
the source code.</p></li></ol></div><p>When you ask your question, display the fact that you have done
these things first; this will help establish that you're not being a
lazy sponge and wasting people's time.  Better yet, display what you have
<span class="emphasis"><em>learned</em></span> from doing these things.  We like answering
questions for people who have demonstrated they can learn from
the answers.</p><p>Use tactics like doing a Google search on the text of whatever
error message you get (searching <a href="http://groups.google.com/" target="_top">Google groups</a> as well as Web
pages).  This might well take you straight to fix documentation or a
mailing list thread answering your question.  Even if it doesn't,
saying “<span class="quote">I googled on the following phrase but didn't get
anything that looked promising</span>” is a good thing to do in e-mail
or news postings requesting help, if only because it records what
searches won't help.  It will also help to direct other people with
similar problems to your thread by linking the search terms to what
will hopefully be your problem and resolution thread.</p><p>Take your time. Do not expect to be able to solve a complicated
problem with a few seconds of Googling. Read and understand the FAQs,
sit back, relax and give the problem some thought before approaching
experts. Trust us, they will be able to tell from your questions how
much reading and thinking you did, and will be more willing to help
if you come prepared. Don't instantly fire your whole arsenal of
questions just because your first search turned up no answers (or too
many).</p><p>Prepare your question.  Think it through.  Hasty-sounding
questions get hasty answers, or none at all.  The more you do to 
demonstrate that having put thought and effort into solving
your problem before seeking help, the more likely you are to
actually get help.</p><p>Beware of asking the wrong question.  If you ask one that is
based on faulty assumptions, J. Random Hacker is quite likely to reply
with a uselessly literal answer while thinking “<span class="quote">Stupid
question...</span>”, and hoping the experience of getting what
you asked for rather than what you needed will teach you a
lesson.</p><p>Never assume you are <span class="emphasis"><em>entitled</em></span> to an answer.
You are not; you aren't, after all, paying for the service.  You will
earn an answer, if you earn it, by asking a substantial, interesting,
and thought-provoking question — one that implicitly contributes
to the experience of the community rather than merely passively
demanding knowledge from others.</p><p>On the other hand, making it clear that you are able and willing
to help in the process of developing the solution is a very good
start. “<span class="quote">Would someone provide a pointer?</span>”, “<span class="quote">What is my
example missing?</span>”, and “<span class="quote">What site should I have
checked?</span>” are more likely to get answered than “<span class="quote">Please
post the exact procedure I should use.</span>”  because you're making it
clear that you're truly willing to complete the process if someone can
just point you in the right direction.</p></div><div class="sect1" xml:lang="en" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both;"><a id="asking"></a>When You Ask</h2></div></div></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="forum"></a>Choose your forum carefully</h3></div></div></div><p>Be sensitive in choosing where you ask your question.  You are
likely to be ignored, or written off as a loser, if you:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>post your question to a forum where it's off topic</p></li><li><p>post a very elementary question to a forum where
advanced technical questions are expected, or vice-versa</p></li><li><p>cross-post to too many different newsgroups</p></li><li><p>post a personal e-mail to somebody who is neither
an acquaintance of yours nor personally responsible for solving your problem</p></li></ul></div><p>Hackers blow off questions that are inappropriately targeted in
order to try to protect their communications channels from being
drowned in irrelevance.  You don't want this to happen to you.</p><p>The first step, therefore, is to find the right forum. Again,
Google and other Web-searching methods are your friend. Use them to
find the project webpage most closely associated with the hardware or
software giving you difficulties. Usually it will have links to a FAQ
(Frequently Asked Questions) list, and to project mailing lists and
their archives. These mailing lists are the final places to go for
help, if your own efforts (including <span class="emphasis"><em>reading</em></span>
those FAQs you found) do not find you a solution.  The project page
may also describe a bug-reporting procedure, or have a link to one; if
so, follow it.</p><p>Shooting off an e-mail to a person or forum which you are not
familiar with is risky at best. For example, do not assume that the
author of an informative webpage wants to be your free consultant.
Do not make optimistic guesses about whether your question will be
welcome — if you're unsure, send it elsewhere, or refrain from
sending it at all.</p><p>When selecting a Web forum, newsgroup or mailing list, don't
trust the name by itself too far; look for a FAQ or charter to verify
your question is on-topic.  Read some of the back traffic before
posting so you'll get a feel for how things are done there. In fact,
it's a very good idea to do a keyword search for words relating to
your problem on the newsgroup or mailing list archives before you
post.  It may find you an answer, and if not it will help you
formulate a better question.</p><p>Don't shotgun-blast all the available help channels at once, that's
like yelling and irritates people.  Step through them softly.</p><p>Know what your topic is!  One of the classic mistakes is asking
questions about the Unix or Windows programming interface in a forum
devoted to a language or library or tool portable across both.
If you don't understand why this is a blunder, you'd be best off not
asking any questions at all until you get it.</p><p>In general, questions to a well-selected public forum are more
likely to get useful answers than equivalent questions to a private
one.  There are multiple reasons for this. One is simply the size of
the pool of potential respondents.  Another is the size of the
audience; hackers would rather answer questions that educate many
people than questions serving only a few.</p><p>Understandably, skilled hackers and authors of popular software are
already receiving more than their fair share of mis-targeted messages.
By adding to the flood, you could in extreme cases even be the straw
that breaks the camel's back — quite a few times, contributors to
popular projects have withdrawn their support because collateral
damage in the form of useless e-mail traffic to their personal accounts
became unbearable.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="usefora"></a>Web and IRC forums directed towards
newbies often give the quickest response</h3></div></div></div><p>Your local user group, or your Linux distribution, may advertise
a Web forum or IRC channel where newbies can get help.  (In
non-English-speaking countries newbie forums are still more likely to
be mailing lists.) These are good first places to ask, especially if
you think you may have tripped over a relatively simple or common
problem. An advertised IRC channel is an open invitation to ask
questions there and often get answers in real time.</p><p>In fact, if you got the program that is giving you problems from
a Linux distribution (as common today), it may be better to ask in the
distro's forum/list before trying the program's project forum/list. The
project's hackers may just say, “<span class="quote">use <span class="emphasis"><em>our</em></span>
build</span>”.</p><p>Before posting to any Web forum, check if it has a Search
feature. If it does, try a couple of keyword searches for
something like your problem; it just might help. If you did a general
Web search before (as you should have), search the forum anyway; your
Web-wide search engine might not have all of this forum indexed
recently.</p><p>There is an increasing tendency for projects to do user support
over a Web forum or IRC channel, with e-mail reserved more for
development traffic. So look for those channels first when seeking
project-specific help.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="uselists"></a>As a second step, use project mailing lists</h3></div></div></div><p>When a project has a development mailing list, write to the
mailing list, not to individual developers, even if you believe
you know who can best answer your question.  Check the documentation
of the project and its homepage for the address of a project mailing
list, and use it.  There are several good reasons for this
policy:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Any question good enough to be asked of one
developer will also be of value to the whole group.  Contrariwise, if
you suspect your question is too dumb for a mailing list, it's not
an excuse to harass individual developers.</p></li><li><p>Asking questions on the list distributes load among
developers.  The individual developer (especially if he's the project
leader) may be too busy to answer your questions.</p></li><li><p>Most mailing lists are archived and the archives are
indexed by search engines.  If you ask your question on-list and it is
answered, a future querent could find your question and the answer on
the Web instead of asking it again.</p></li><li><p>If certain questions are seen to be asked often,
developers can use that information to improve the documentation or the
software itself to be less confusing.  But if those questions are
asked in private, nobody has the complete picture of what questions
are asked most often.</p></li></ul></div><p>If a project has both a “<span class="quote">user</span>” and a
“<span class="quote">developer</span>” (or “<span class="quote">hacker</span>”) mailing list or
Web forum, and you are not hacking on the code, ask in the
“<span class="quote">user</span>” list/forum. Do not assume that you will
be welcome on the developer list, where they're likely to experience
your question as noise disrupting their developer traffic.</p><p>However, if you are <span class="emphasis"><em>sure</em></span> your question is
non-trivial, and you get no answer in the “<span class="quote">user</span>”
list/forum for several days, try the “<span class="quote">developer</span>” one.
You would be well advised to lurk there for a few days before posting
to learn the local folkways (actually this is good advice on any
private or semi-private list).</p><p>If you cannot find a project's mailing list address, but only
see the address of the maintainer of the project, go ahead and write
to the maintainer.  But even in that case, don't assume that the
mailing list doesn't exist.  Mention in your e-mail that you tried and
could not find the appropriate mailing list.  Also mention that you
don't object to having your message forwarded to other people.  (Many
people believe that private e-mail should remain private, even if
there is nothing secret in it.  By allowing your message to be
forwarded you give your correspondent a choice about how to handle
your e-mail.)</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="bespecific"></a>Use meaningful, specific subject headers</h3></div></div></div><p>On mailing lists, newsgroups or Web forums, the subject header
is your golden opportunity to attract qualified experts' attention in
around 50 characters or fewer.  Don't waste it on babble like
“<span class="quote">Please help me</span>” (let alone “<span class="quote">PLEASE HELP
ME!!!!</span>”; messages with subjects like that get discarded by
reflex).  Don't try to impress us with the depth of your anguish; use
the space for a super-concise problem description instead.</p><p>One good convention for subject headers, used by many tech support
organizations, is “<span class="quote">object - deviation</span>”. The
“<span class="quote">object</span>” part specifies what thing or group of things is
having a problem, and the “<span class="quote">deviation</span>” part describes the
deviation from expected behavior.</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>Stupid:</strong></span>

description will help you organize your thinking about the problem in
more detail. What is affected?  Just the mouse cursor or other
graphics too?  Is this specific to the X.org version of X? To version
6.8.1?  Is this specific to Fooware video chipsets? To model MV1005?  A
hacker who sees the result can immediately understand what it is that
you are having a problem with <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> the problem you
are having, at a glance.</p><p>More generally, imagine looking at the index of an archive of
questions, with just the subject lines showing.  Make your subject
line reflect your question well enough that the next guy searching the
archive with a question similar to yours will be able to follow the
thread to an answer rather than posting the question again.</p><p>If you ask a question in a reply, be sure to change the subject
line to indicate that you're asking a question.  A Subject line that
looks like “<span class="quote">Re: test</span>” or “<span class="quote">Re: new bug</span>” is
less likely to attract useful amounts of attention.  Also, pare quotation
of previous messages to the minimum consistent with cluing in new
readers.</p><p>Do not simply hit reply to a list message in order to start an
entirely new thread. This will limit your audience. Some mail readers,
like mutt, allow the user to sort by thread and then hide messages in
a thread by folding the thread. Folks who do that will never see your
message.</p><p>Changing the subject is not sufficient.  Mutt, and probably other mail
readers, looks at other information in the e-mail's headers to assign
it to a thread, not the subject line. Instead start an entirely new
e-mail.</p><p>On Web forums the rules of good practice are slightly different,
because messages are usually much more tightly bound to specific
discussion threads and often invisible outside those threads.
Changing the subject when asking a question in reply is not essential.
Not all forums even allow separate subject lines on replies, and
nearly nobody reads them when they do. However, asking a question in a
reply is a dubious practice in itself, because it will only be seen by
those who are watching this thread. So, unless you are sure you
<span class="emphasis"><em>want</em></span> to ask only the people currently active in the
thread, start a new one.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="easyreply"></a>Make it easy to reply</h3></div></div></div><p>Finishing your query with “<span class="quote">Please send your reply
to... </span>” makes it quite unlikely you will get an answer.  If you
can't be bothered to take even the few seconds required to set up a
correct Reply-To header in your mail agent, we can't be bothered to
take even a few seconds to think about your problem.  If your mail
program doesn't permit this, <a href="http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Mail/muas.html" target="_top">get a better mail
program</a>.  If your operating system doesn't support any e-mail
programs that permit this, get a better operating system.</p><p>In Web forums, asking for a reply by e-mail is outright rude,
unless you believe the information may be sensitive (and somebody
will, for some unknown reason, let you but not the whole forum know
it). If you want an e-mail copy when somebody replies in the thread,
request that the Web forum  send it; this feature is supported
almost everywhere under options like “<span class="quote">watch this thread</span>”,
“<span class="quote">send e-mail on answers</span>”, etc.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="writewell"></a>Write in clear, grammatical, correctly-spelled language</h3></div></div></div><p>We've found by experience that people who are careless and
sloppy writers are usually also careless and sloppy at thinking and
coding (often enough to bet on, anyway). Answering questions for
careless and sloppy thinkers is not rewarding; we'd rather spend our
time elsewhere.</p><p>So expressing your question clearly and well is important.  If
you can't be bothered to do that, we can't be bothered to pay
attention.  Spend the extra effort to polish your language.  It
doesn't have to be stiff or formal — in fact, hacker culture
values informal, slangy and humorous language used with precision.
But it has to <span class="emphasis"><em>be</em></span> precise; there has to be some
indication that you're thinking and paying attention.</p><p>Spell, punctuate, and capitalize correctly.  Don't confuse
“<span class="quote">its</span>” with “<span class="quote">it's</span>”, “<span class="quote">loose</span>” with
“<span class="quote">lose</span>”, or “<span class="quote">discrete</span>” with
“<span class="quote">discreet</span>”.  Don't TYPE IN ALL CAPS; this is read as
shouting and considered rude. (All-smalls is only slightly less
annoying, as it's difficult to read.  Alan Cox can get away with it,
but you can't.)</p><p>More generally, if you write like a semi-literate boob you will
very likely be ignored.  So don't use instant-messaging shortcuts.
Spelling "you" as "u" makes you look like a semi-literate boob to save
two entire keystrokes.  Worse: writing like a l33t script kiddie hax0r is
the absolute kiss of death and guarantees you will receive nothing but
stony silence (or, at best, a heaping helping of scorn and sarcasm) in
return.</p><p>If you are asking questions in a forum that does not use your
native language, you will get a limited amount of slack for spelling
and grammar errors — but no extra slack at all for laziness (and
yes, we can usually spot that difference).  Also, unless you know what
your respondent's languages are, write in English.  Busy hackers tend
to simply flush questions in languages they don't understand, and
English is the working language of the Internet.  By writing in
English you minimize your chances that your question will be discarded
unread.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="formats"></a>Send questions in accessible, standard formats</h3></div></div></div><p>If you make your question artificially hard to read, it is more

real content (such as an attached source file or patch), and not
merely boilerplate generated by your mail client (such as another copy
of your message).</p></li><li><p> Don't send e-mail in which entire paragraphs are single
multiply-wrapped lines.  (This makes it too difficult to reply to 
just part of the message.)  Assume that your respondents will be
reading mail on 80-character-wide text displays and set your 
line wrap accordingly, to something less than 80.</p></li><li><p> However, do <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> wrap data (such

English-language forum.  This encoding can be necessary when you're
posting in a language ASCII doesn't cover, but many e-mail agents
don't support it.  When they break, all those =20 glyphs scattered
through the text are ugly and distracting — or may actively
sabotage the semantics of your text.</p></li><li><p> Never, <span class="emphasis"><em>ever</em></span> expect hackers to be
able to read closed proprietary document formats like Microsoft Word

</p></li><li><p>In Web forums, do not abuse “<span class="quote">smiley</span>” and
“<span class="quote">HTML</span>” features (when they are present). A smiley or two
is usually OK, but colored fancy text tends to make people think you
are lame.  Seriously overusing smileys and color and fonts will make
you come off like a giggly teenage girl, which is not generally a good
idea unless you are more interested in sex than answers.</p></li></ul></div><p>If you're using a graphical-user-interface mail client such as
Netscape Messenger, MS Outlook, or their ilk, beware that it may

provide a source-code patch that fixes the problem, or a regression
test against a previous version that demonstrates incorrect behavior,
you are probably not sure enough.  This applies to webpages and
documentation, too; if you have found a documentation
“<span class="quote">bug</span>”, you should supply replacement text and which pages
it should go on.</p><p>Remember, there are many other users that are not
experiencing your problem. Otherwise you would have learned about it
while reading the documentation and searching the Web (you did do that
before complaining, <a href="#before" title="Before You Ask">didn't you</a>?). This
means that very probably it is you who are doing something wrong, not
the software.</p><p>The people who wrote the software work very hard to make it work
as well as possible. If you claim you have found a bug, you'll be
impugning their competence, which may offend some of them even if you

in the Subject line.</p><p>When asking your question, it is best to write as though you
assume <span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> are doing something wrong, even if you

really is a bug, you will hear about it in the answer.  Play it so the

than so that you will owe them an apology if you have messed up.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id306968"></a>Grovelling is not a substitute for doing your homework</h3></div></div></div><p>Some people who get that they shouldn't behave rudely or

Missouri." That US state's official motto is "Show me" (earned in
1899, when Congressman Willard D. Vandiver said "I come from a country
that raises corn and cotton and cockleburs and Democrats, and frothy
eloquence neither convinces nor satisfies me. I'm from Missouri.
You've got to show me.") In diagnosticians' case, it's not a matter of
skepticism, but rather a literal, functional need to see whatever is
as close as possible to the same raw evidence that you see, rather
than your surmises and summaries. Show us.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="chronology"></a>Describe your problem's symptoms in chronological order</h3></div></div></div><p>The clues most useful in figuring out something that went wrong

did, leading up to the blowup.  In the case of command-line processes,
having a session log (e.g., using the script utility) and quoting the
relevant twenty or so lines is very useful.</p><p>If the program that blew up on you has diagnostic options (such
as -v for verbose), try to select options that will add useful
debugging information to the transcript.  Remember that more is not
necessarily better; try to choose a debug level that will inform
rather than drowning the reader in junk.</p><p>If your account ends up being long (more than about four paragraphs),

process during which a first try at an answer can and should be
corrected if someone more knowledgeable notices that it is incomplete or
incorrect.  Also, helpers get some of their reward for being
respondents from being seen to be competent and knowledgeable by
their peers.</p><p>When you ask for a private reply, you are disrupting both the
process and the reward.  Don't do this.  It's the
<span class="emphasis"><em>respondent's</em></span> choice whether to reply privately 
— and if he does, it's usually because he thinks the question is
too ill-formed or obvious to be interesting to others.</p><p>There is one limited exception to this rule.  If you think
the question is such that you are likely to get many answers that
are all closely similar, then the magic words are “<span class="quote">e-mail me and I'll
summarize the answers for the group</span>”.  It is courteous to try and save 
the mailing list or newsgroup a flood of substantially identical
postings — but you have to keep the promise to summarize.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="explicit"></a>Be explicit about your question</h3></div></div></div><p>Open-ended questions tend to be perceived as open-ended time
sinks.  Those people most likely to be able to give you a useful answer
are also the busiest people (if only because they take on the most
work themselves).  People like that are allergic to open-ended time
sinks, thus they tend to be allergic to open-ended questions.</p><p>You are more likely to get a useful response if you are
explicit about what you want respondents to do (provide pointers,
send code, check your patch, whatever).  This will focus their 
effort and implicitly put an upper bound on the time and energy 
a respondent must allocate to helping you.  This is good.</p><p>To understand the world the experts live in, think of expertise
as an abundant resource and time to respond as a scarce one.  The less
of a time commitment you implicitly ask for, the more likely you are
to get an answer from someone really good and really busy.</p><p>So it is useful to frame your question to minimize the time
commitment required for an expert to field it — but this is
often not the same thing as simplifying the question.  Thus, for
example, “<span class="quote">Would you give me a pointer to a good explanation of
X?</span>” is usually a smarter question than “<span class="quote">Would you explain
X, please?</span>”.  If you have some malfunctioning code, it is
usually smarter to ask for someone to explain what's wrong with it
than it is to ask someone to fix it.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="code"></a>When asking about code</h3></div></div></div><p>Don't ask others to debug your broken code without giving a hint

see &lt;x&gt;, but &lt;y&gt; occurred instead" is much more likely to

you're using the program in some high-profile place, one that the
hackers will get excited about; in such a case, if you're under time
pressure, and you say so politely, people may get interested enough to
answer faster.</p><p>This is a very risky thing to do, however, because the hackers'
metric for what is exciting probably differs from yours.  Posting from
the International Space Station would qualify, for example, but
posting on behalf of a feel-good charitable or political cause would
almost certainly not.  In fact, posting “<span class="quote">Urgent: Help me save

you; let them know how it came out and thank them again for their
help. If the problem attracted general interest in a mailing list or
newsgroup, it's appropriate to post the followup there.</p><p>Optimally, the reply should be to the thread started by the
original question posting, and should have ‘FIXED’,
‘RESOLVED’ or an equally obvious tag in the subject line.
On mailing lists with fast turnaround, a potential respondent who sees
a thread about “<span class="quote">Problem X</span>” ending with “<span class="quote">Problem X -
FIXED</span>” knows not to waste his/her time even reading the thread
(unless (s)he) personally finds Problem X interesting) and can
therefore use that time solving a different problem.</p><p>Your followup doesn't have to be long and involved; a simple
“<span class="quote">Howdy — it was a failed network cable! Thanks, everyone. -
Bill</span>” would be better than nothing.  In fact, a short and sweet
summary is better than a long dissertation unless the solution has
real technical depth.  Say what action solved the problem, but you
need not replay the whole troubleshooting sequence.</p><p>For problems with some depth, it is appropriate to post a
summary of the troubleshooting history. Describe your final problem
statement.  Describe what worked as a solution, and indicate avoidable
blind alleys <span class="emphasis"><em>after that</em></span>. The blind alleys should
come after the correct solution and other summary material, rather
than turning the follow-up into a detective story. Name the names of
people who helped you; you'll make friends that way.</p><p>Besides being courteous and informative, this sort of followup
will help others searching the archive of the mailing-list/newsgroup/forum
to know exactly which solution helped you and thus may also help
them.</p><p>Last, and not least, this sort of followup helps everybody who
assisted feel a satisfying sense of closure about the problem.  If you
are not a techie or hacker yourself, trust us that this feeling is
very important to the gurus and experts you tapped for help. Problem
narratives that trail off into unresolved nothingness are frustrating
things; hackers itch to see them resolved.  The goodwill that
scratching that itch earns you will be very, very helpful to you next
time you need to pose a question. </p><p>Consider how you might be able to prevent others from having the
same problem in the future.  Ask yourself if a documentation or FAQ
patch would help, and if the answer is yes send that patch to the
maintainer.</p><p>Among hackers, this sort of good followup behavior is actually
more important than conventional politeness.  It's how you get a
reputation for playing well with others, which can be a very valuable
asset.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" xml:lang="en" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both;"><a id="answers"></a>How To Interpret Answers</h2></div></div></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="rtfm"></a>RTFM and STFW: How To Tell You've Seriously Screwed Up</h3></div></div></div><p>There is an ancient and hallowed tradition: if you get a reply

“<span class="quote">STFW</span>”, the person who sent it thinks you should have
Searched The Fucking Web.  He or she is almost certainly right.  Go search
it. (The milder version of this is when you are told “<span class="quote">Google is

archives. In fact, someone may even be so kind as to provide a pointer
to the previous thread where this problem was solved. But do not rely
on this consideration; do your archive-searching before asking.</p><p>Often, the person telling you to do a search has the manual
or the web page with the information you need open, and is looking at
it as he or she types. These replies mean that he thinks (a) the information
you need is easy to find, and (b) you will learn more if you seek out
the information than if you have it spoon-fed to you.</p><p>You shouldn't be offended by this; by hacker standards, your

ignoring you.  You should instead be thankful for this grandmotherly
kindness.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="lesser"></a>If you don't understand...</h3></div></div></div><p>If you don't understand the answer, do not immediately bounce
back a demand for clarification.  Use the same tools that you used to
try and answer your original question (manuals, FAQs, the Web, skilled
friends) to understand the answer.  Then, if you still need to ask for
clarification, exhibit what you have learned.</p><p>For example, suppose I tell you: “<span class="quote">It sounds like you've

question: “<span class="quote">OK, I read the man page and zentries are only

here?</span>”</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="keepcool"></a>Dealing with rudeness</h3></div></div></div><p>Much of what looks like rudeness in hacker circles is not
intended to give offense.  Rather, it's the product of the direct,
cut-through-the-bullshit communications style that is natural to
people who are more concerned about solving problems than making
others feel warm and fuzzy.</p><p>When you perceive rudeness, try to react calmly.  If someone
is really acting out, it is very likely a senior person on the
list or newsgroup or forum will call him or her on it.  If that 
<span class="emphasis"><em>doesn't</em></span> happen and you lose your temper, it
is likely that the person you lose it at was behaving within the
hacker community's norms and <span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> will be
considered at fault.  This will hurt your chances of getting the
information or help you want.</p><p>On the other hand, you will occasionally run across rudeness and
posturing that is quite gratuitous.  The flip-side of the above is
that it is acceptable form to slam real offenders quite hard,
dissecting their misbehavior with a sharp verbal scalpel.  Be very,
very sure of your ground before you try this, however.  The line
between correcting an incivility and starting a pointless flamewar is thin
enough that hackers themselves not infrequently blunder across it; if
you are a newbie or an outsider, your chances of avoiding such a
blunder are low.  If you're after information rather than entertainment,
it's better to keep your fingers off the keyboard than to risk this.</p><p>(Some people assert that many hackers have a mild form of autism
or Asperger's Syndrome, and are actually missing some of the brain
circuitry that lubricates “<span class="quote">normal</span>” human social
interaction.  This may or may not be true.  If you are not a hacker
yourself, it may help you cope with our eccentricities if you think of
us as being brain-damaged.  Go right ahead.  We won't care; we
<span class="emphasis"><em>like</em></span> being whatever it is we are, and generally
have a healthy skepticism about clinical labels.)</p><p>In the next section, we'll talk about a different issue; 
the kind of “<span class="quote">rudeness</span>” you'll see when <span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> 
misbehave.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" xml:lang="en" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both;"><a id="not_losing"></a>On Not Reacting Like A Loser</h2></div></div></div><p>Odds are you'll screw up a few times on hacker community
forums — in ways detailed in this article, or similar.  And
you'll be told exactly how you screwed up, possibly with colourful
asides.  In public.</p><p>When this happens, the worst thing you can do is whine about the
experience, claim to have been verbally assaulted, demand apologies,
scream, hold your breath, threaten lawsuits, complain to people's
employers, leave the toilet seat up, etc.  Instead, here's what you
do:</p><p>Get over it.  It's normal.  In fact, it's healthy and appropriate.</p><p>Community standards do not maintain themselves: They're
maintained by people actively applying them, visibly, <span class="emphasis"><em>in
public</em></span>.  Don't whine that all criticism should have been
conveyed via private e-mail: That's not how it works.  Nor is it useful
to insist you've been personally insulted when someone comments that
one of your claims was wrong, or that his views differ.  Those are
loser attitudes.</p><p>There have been hacker forums where, out of some misguided sense of
hyper-courtesy, participants are banned from posting any fault-finding
with another's posts, and told “<span class="quote">Don't say anything if you're unwilling
to help the user.</span>”  The resulting departure of clueful participants to
elsewhere causes them to descend into meaningless babble and become
useless as technical forums.</p><p>Exaggeratedly “<span class="quote">friendly</span>” (in that fashion) or useful:  Pick one.</p><p>Remember:  When that hacker tells you that you've screwed up, and (no
matter how gruffly) tells you not to do it again, he's acting out of
concern for (1) you and (2) his community.  It would be much easier for him
to ignore you and filter you out of his life.  If you can't manage to be
grateful, at least have a little dignity, don't whine, and don't expect
to be treated like a fragile doll just because you're a newcomer with
a theatrically hypersensitive soul and delusions of entitlement.</p><p>Sometimes people will attack you personally, flame without an
apparent reason, etc., even if you don't screw up (or have only
screwed up in their imagination). In this case, complaining is the way
to <span class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> screw up.</p><p>These flamers are either lamers who don't have a clue but
believe themselves to be experts, or would-be psychologists testing
whether you'll screw up. The other readers either ignore them, or find
ways to deal with them on their own. The flamers' behavior creates
problems for themselves, which don't have to concern you.</p><p>Don't let yourself be drawn into a flamewar, either. Most flames
are best ignored — after you've checked whether they are really flames,
not pointers to the ways in which you have screwed up, and not cleverly
ciphered answers to your real question (this happens as well).</p></div><div class="sect1" xml:lang="en" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both;"><a id="classic"></a>Questions Not To Ask</h2></div></div></div><p>Here are some classic stupid questions, and what hackers are thinking

demonstrated respect for my peers' ability and invited them to consult
with me as a peer.  I also demonstrated respect for the value of their
time by telling them the blind alleys I had already run down.</p><p>Afterwards, when I thanked everyone and remarked how well the
process had worked, an lkml member observed that he thought it had
worked not because I'm a “<span class="quote">name</span>” on that list, but because
I asked the question in the proper form.</p><p>Hackers are in some ways a very ruthless meritocracy; I'm

we don't feel we can help you. Sometimes the members of the asked
group may simply not know the answer.  No response is not the same
as being ignored, though admittedly it's hard to spot the difference
from outside.</p><p>In general, simply re-posting your question is a bad idea.  This
will be seen as pointlessly annoying.  Have patience: the person with
your answer may be in a different time-zone and asleep. Or it may be
that your question wasn't well-formed to begin with.</p><p>There are other sources of help you can go to, often sources
better adapted to a novice's needs.</p><p>There are many online and local user groups who are enthusiasts
about the software, even though they may never have written any
software themselves. These groups often form so that people can help
each other and help new users.</p><p>There are also plenty of commercial companies you can contract
with for help, both large and small (Red Hat and SpikeSource are two of
the best known; there are many others). Don't be dismayed at the idea
of having to pay for a bit of help! After all, if your car engine
blows a head gasket, chances are you would take it to a repair shop
and pay to get it fixed. Even if the software didn't cost you
anything, you can't expect that support to always come for
free.</p><p>For popular software like Linux, there are at least 10,000 users
per developer. It's just not possible for one person to handle the
support calls from over 10,000 users. Remember that even if you have to
pay for support, you are still paying much less than if you had to buy
the software as well (and support for closed-source software is usually more
expensive and less competent than support for open-source software).</p></div><div class="sect1" xml:lang="en" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both;"><a id="id308223"></a>How To Answer Questions in a Helpful Way</h2></div></div></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Be gentle.</em></span> Problem-related stress can make
