<p>This is a note on how to use gdb memory dumping
only for study purpose.
Not to be used in reverse engineering softwares,
which is ILLEGAL!</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Software companies use some kind of mechanism to protect their product.
For example, Apply employ <a href="http://www.osxbook.com/book/bonus/chapter7/binaryprotection/">Apple Binary Protection</a> to do this.
The binary is encrypted such that one is hard to disassemble it.
The OS will do decryption when it loads the binary into memory.
Hence, by utilizing this point one can dump an unencrypted program.</p>

<h1>Basic idea</h1>

<p>(<a href="http://reverse.put.as/2009/06/30/how-to-dump-an-apple-protected-binary/">Source</a>):</p>

<blockquote><ol>
<li>Load the app into gdb (or attach to the already running process). Just let the app load and then break into gdb with control-c (if you are starting from gdb).</li>
<li>Check with vmmap the memory region for the <code>__TEXT</code> segment for the program you want to dump.</li>
<li>Dump that memory region to a file using gdb “dump memory” command.</li>
<li>Write the memory dump into the original file (you must replace the original <code>__TEXT</code> segment with the dumped one). You can use copy&amp;paste inside an hex editor (that’s what I did), or you can use Pedram trick with “dd” (that’s what I should have done, DOH). Don’t forget to calculate the correct offset for the <code>__TEXT</code> segment (beware with fat binaries). My first approach was to dump the whole program, when in reality only the <code>__TEXT</code> segment is required. Hey, it was a quick test and I give it a little thought while getting ready to write this  .</li>
<li>Fix the flags for <code>LC_SEGMENT/__TEXT</code> from <code>0×8</code> to <code>0×0</code> (else it will still try to decrypt the binary and the result will be garbage and a nice crash).</li>
<li>That’s it.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Details</h1>

<h2>Encryption tools</h2>

<p>An encryption tool is provided <a href="http://www.osxbook.com/book/bonus/chapter7/binaryprotection/">here</a> and another <a href="http://quatermain.tumblr.com/post/97884723/apple-binary-protection-tool">here</a>.
The second one is a derivative of the first one.
However, both of them are kind of out-dated (tested in 10.5)
and does not work well in my system (OSX 10.6.7).
I tried to use them to encrypt <code>/bin/ls</code>, either <code>i386</code> or <code>x86-64</code>,
but both of them fail to generate a correct binary that runs.
Hence, I have to find some already-encrypted binary to use.
In this case I choosed <code>/System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app</code>.</p>

<h2>Decryption tools</h2>

<p>A dumper written in C is provided in <a href="http://reverse.put.as/2009/07/08/a-memory-dumper-for-apple-crypted-binaries-hurray/">here</a>. However, it does not support
64b. I did not test it thouroughly, and I want to do it using existing tools and scripts.</p>

<h2>Prerequisite and Tools needed</h2>

<p>The reader should understand the structure of Mach-O file.
See <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/MachORuntime/Reference/reference.html">here</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/MachORuntime/art/mach_o_segments.gif" alt="mach-o structure" /></p>

<p>Tools:</p>

<ul>
<li>otool</li>
<li>gdb</li>
<li>dd</li>
</ul>


<p>They are all available with Snow Leopard 10.6.7.</p>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<p>For simplicity I want to do the i386 first (x86_64 may be added later...).
Here's how:</p>

<pre><code># make a i386-only binary 
$ ditto --rsrc --arch i386 /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/MacOS/Finder Finder-i386
$ file Finder-i386
Finder-i386: Mach-O executable i386

# Use otool to obtain some information:
$ otool Finder-i386
... (removed)
Load command 1
      cmd LC_SEGMENT
  cmdsize 736
  segname __TEXT
   vmaddr 0x00001000   # start address to dump!
   vmsize 0x00344000   # vmaddr + vmsize = 0x00345000 = end address to dump!
  fileoff 0            # offset of this section in the binary file
 filesize 3424256      # length of this section
  maxprot 0x00000007
 initprot 0x00000005
   nsects 10
    flags 0x8          # 0x8 marks encrypted, need to change to 0x0 afterwards
... (removed)
$ gdb Finder-i386 # load into gdb
(gdb) b *0x1000 # break at start of __TEXT segment
(gdb) dump memory Finder-i386.bin 0x00001000 0x00345000 # the offset is obtained from otool
# quit gdb
$ dd bs=1 conv=notrunc if=Finder-i386.bin of=Finder-i386 # replace the original __TEXT section
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, use a hex editor to manually replace the flags from 0x8 to 0x0.
The offset can be found by referencing the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/MachORuntime/Reference/reference.html">data structures</a> of Mach-O header and load commands.</p>
